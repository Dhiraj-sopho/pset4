Problem Set 4

1. stdint.h is a c standard library which allows the user to create custumized integer data types using typedef of different widths or bits sizes.
2. u stands for unsigned. The number defines the the width or size in bits of the data type.
3. BYTE- 1byte   DWORD- 4 bytes    LONG- 4 bytes   WORD- 2bytes
4. In ASCII the the first two bytes of BMP file is BM
5. bfsize is the size of the BMP file. bisize is the size of the second header.
6. If the biHeight is negative then the bitmap is top down and its origin is in the upper left hand corner
7. biBitCount
8. It may return null if the file was not been able to be created for some reasons like not having the permission to do so or the lack of memory, etc.
9. The third argument denotes the number of times the block of particular size will be read. In our case the third argument is 1 because we want to read only one pixel at a time.
10. 3
11. fseek sets the position in the file from where the file will be read.
12 SEEK_CUR is the present location of the pointer in the file from where the file is being read.
